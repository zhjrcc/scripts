This brief example demonstrates the flexibility of using array notation to access properties of an object with string expressions. This code could be rewritten using the dot notation, but there are cases in which only the array notation will do. Suppose, for example, that you are writing a program that uses network resources to compute the current value of the userâ€™s stock market investments. The program allows the user to type in the name of each stock they own as well as the number of shares of each stock. You might use an object named portfolio to hold this information. The object has one property for each stock. The name of the property is the name of the stock, and the property value is the number of shares of that stock. So, for example, if a user holds 50 shares of stock in IBM, the portfolio.ibm property has the value 50.
